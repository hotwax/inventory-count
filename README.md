## How to build application in different environment or modes(staging, production, qa, etc)?

As there is a bug in Ionic cli due to which we cannot pass flag variables for commands (See [#4669](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-cli/issues/4642)). To build application in different modes we need to use vue-cli-service to build and then use the built app using capacitor copy command further.

Follow following instructions:

1. Manually build the application using vue-cli-service:
   npx vue-cli-service build --mode=sandbox

2. Copy web assets to the native project without building the app:
   ionic capacitor copy ios --no-build

3. Open the Android Studio / XCode project:
   ionic capacitor open android  
   ionic capacitor open ios
